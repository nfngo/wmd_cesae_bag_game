# wmd_cesae_bag_game
## "Bag game" developed with Java

This project was developed as a task for CESAE's Web & Mobile Development Course.

The "bag game" is a portuguese radio program, broadcasted by RÃ¡dio Brigantia. Daily, listeners call to try to guess the weight of a bag given an weight interval (by the host). The winner is the listener that guesses the closest weight.

In this app, we can add, edit or delete listeners, see their data, check the game ranking and play.

PS: "Code" and Comments in Portuguese
